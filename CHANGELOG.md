Change Log
==========

Unreleased
----------------------------

 * The per-thread counters keep only JDK classes in their ThreadLocal: a driver class stored there kept the driver's
   class loader (and its jar file) alive on long-lived pooled threads, preventing the runtime from replacing the jar
 * `MockJdbcDriver.deregister()` removes the driver from `DriverManager`, for containers that unload it
 * Fixed: a `/tables/<name>.csv` inside a jar on the classpath failed with "URI is not hierarchical" (also in the
   original dummyjdbc); it is now read from the jar, without caching so the jar is not kept open

Version 2.0.0 (2026-10-08)
----------------------------

 * Repeated use of a resource: `users#1`, `users#2`, ... are returned by the 1st, 2nd, ... query on `users` (falling back
   to `users`), and every write is also kept as `<name>_PARAMS#n`; one counter per name, per thread, restarted by
   `reset()` / `resetCounters()` and, inside Boomi, automatically on a new top level execution (Try/Catch continuations keep the counters) or with the
   property `mockjdbc#RESET`
 * The step counter is per thread
 * Project renamed from dummyjdbc to **mockjdbc**: package `me.avogadro.mockjdbc`, driver class
   `me.avogadro.mockjdbc.MockJdbcDriver` (all `Dummy*` classes are now `Mock*`), Maven coordinates
   `me.avogadro.mockjdbc:mockjdbc`, Boomi property prefix `mockjdbc_`, metadata product name `MockJDBC`
 * Build: Java 8 target and AspectJ weaving with `dev.aspectj:aspectj-maven-plugin` 1.14 / AspectJ 1.9.22.1 (works on
   current JDKs); the runtime dependency `aspectjrt` moves to 1.9.22.1
 * Fixed: UPDATE without a `-- TESTCASE` comment was never captured; INSERT/UPDATE spanning several lines were not
   recognised; the `-- TESTCASE` name kept a trailing `\r` with CRLF line endings and swallowed the following lines of a
   multi-line query
 * Fixed: `DatabaseMetaData` returned `null` from many methods (NullPointerException in the Boomi Database V2 connector);
   now descriptive values and empty result sets with the standard JDBC columns
 * Parameters are captured for every prepared statement except SELECTs: also DELETE and stored procedure calls
   (`EXEC`, `EXECUTE`, `CALL`, `{call ...}`); SELECTs with a TESTCASE comment or on a step no longer write `_PARAMS`
 * Stored procedure results are also found for `CALL my_proc(...)`, `{call my_proc(...)}` and calls on several lines
 * `getLong`, `getShort`, `getByte`, `getDouble`, `getFloat` and `getRow()` are implemented for CSV result sets
 * `ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()` / `getColumnLabel()` return the column names as written in the CSV header
   (were upper case, e.g. Boomi Database V2 documents had keys `ID`, `NAME` instead of `id`, `name`)
 * `DatabaseMetaData.getColumns` describes the columns of a table from its CSV header (resolved as for a query), so the
   Boomi Database V2 connector can bind parameters by type; new header types `|bigint`, `|decimal`, `|boolean`
 * `getGeneratedKeys()` returns an empty result set (was null: every Boomi DB V2 insert failed), `addBatch()` /
   `executeBatch()` run the statement once per parameter set ("Commit By Rows"), `setMaxRows()` is honoured
 * `setLong`, `setShort`, `setByte`, `setFloat`, `setBoolean`, `setNull`, `setObject(..., type)` and `clearParameters()`
   are captured/honoured; `findColumn()` is implemented; `SELECT 1` and unknown tables return metadata (was null)
 * NULL convention: an empty value in a column with a declared type other than `varchar` is SQL NULL (`wasNull()`
   is implemented); `getObject()` returns the Java type of the declared column type
 * Driver version reported as 2.0 (was 1.0)
 * Boomi support through Dynamic Process Properties (detected at runtime via reflection, no dependency on Boomi):
   tables can be provided as `mockjdbc_<name>` properties (name as written, then lower case) and captured
   INSERT/UPDATE parameters are exposed as `mockjdbc_<table>_PARAMS` and `mockjdbc_<table in lower case>_params`
   (never persisted)
