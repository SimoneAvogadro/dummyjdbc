# Future ideas

Improvements that were identified while documenting the library (see [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)) but are **not
implemented yet**. Each item says what is missing today and what a change would involve.

## Result set getters

### 1. SQL `NULL` in varchar columns

* **Today:** an empty value is SQL `NULL` only in columns with a declared type other than `varchar`; in `varchar` (or
  untyped) columns it is the empty string, so a `NULL` string cannot be mocked. The CSV reader (opencsv 2.3) does not
  tell an unquoted empty value from a quoted one (`""`).
* **Idea:** an opt-in marker for NULL in varchar columns (e.g. a configurable token such as `\N`), or a CSV reader that
  distinguishes unquoted empty values.

## Date and time handling

### 2. ISO-style default formats

* **Today:** the defaults are `dd-MMM-yy`, `HH:mm`, `yyyyMMdd HHmmss.SSS`. The date format depends on the JVM
  locale, the time default drops seconds, and the timestamp default requires milliseconds. Users have to call
  `setDateFormat` / `setTimeFormat` / `setTimestampFormat` in every thread.
* **Idea:** default to ISO patterns (`yyyy-MM-dd`, `HH:mm:ss`, `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss[.SSS]`), possibly accepting several
  patterns per getter, and use a fixed locale for month names.
* **Compatibility:** breaking for existing CSVs and `?params` keys that use the current formats; consider a major version
  or a switch to select the old behaviour.

### 3. Format settings shared across threads and reset by `reset()`

* **Today:** the formats are `ThreadLocal`, so they apply only to the calling thread, and `reset()` does not restore
  the defaults.
* **Idea:** a process-wide setting (with thread-local override if needed) and restore the defaults in `reset()`.

## Encoding

### 4. Explicit charset for `InputStream` resources

* **Today:** `addInMemoryTableResource(String, InputStream)` and `addInMemoryTableResource(int, InputStream)` read the stream
  with the default charset of the VM, like CSV files.
* **Idea:** add overloads taking a `Charset` for streams whose encoding differs from the VM default.

## Resources and connections

### 5. CallableStatement (`Connection.prepareCall`)

* **Today:** `prepareCall(...)` returns `null`, so code (or a Boomi "Stored Procedure" operation) that calls a
  procedure through a `CallableStatement` fails. Stored procedures work only through `prepareStatement` /
  `createStatement` with `EXEC`, `EXECUTE`, `CALL` or `{call ...}`.
* **Idea:** return a `CallableStatement` built on `CsvPreparedStatement` (same lookup and parameter capture), with OUT
  parameters registered and read back from the CSV result or from dedicated resources.

### 6. Database directories loaded lazily

* **Today:** for `jdbc::mock::<dir>` URLs the CSV files are read when `connect()` is called. After `reset()`, a connection
  that is already open no longer sees those tables (new connections reload them).
* **Idea:** look up the directory on demand (or re-register it after `reset()`) so open connections keep working.

### 7. Table-name detection for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

* **Today:** the table of an `INSERT INTO <table> (` / `UPDATE <table>` is matched with letters only (`[a-zA-Z]`), so names
  containing digits or underscores (`user_roles`, `table2`) are not captured under `<table>_PARAMS`; a `-- TESTCASE:` comment
  is needed.
* **Idea:** accept `[A-Za-z0-9_$.]` (and schema-qualified names), with tests for each form.

### 8. Precedence between files and in-memory resources

* **Today:** if both a registered file and an in-memory resource exist for the same name, the **file wins**
  (step resources always win over both).
* **Idea:** decide whether in-memory should override files, since it is registered closer to the test; document the
  decision either way.

## Build

### 9. Logging dependencies and the AspectJ tracing aspect

* **Today:** the build targets Java 8 and works on current JDKs (AspectJ weaving via `dev.aspectj:aspectj-maven-plugin`).
  `logback-classic`/`logback-core` are still declared as normal dependencies, so they end up in the classpath of every
  application using the driver, and the tracing aspect (`AspectLogger.aj`) requires the AspectJ runtime (`aspectjrt`), one more jar
  to install wherever the driver runs (e.g. Boomi).
* **Idea:** move logback to the `test` scope, and decide whether the TRACE logging of every public method is still worth
  the AspectJ build step and runtime.

## Documentation

### 10. Slimmer README

* **Today:** the README links to `FEATURES.md`, but its older sections ("New Methods in 1.4.0", "1.5.0", sample usage)
  partly duplicate it, and it still refers to the old Maven coordinates and the upstream wiki.
* **Idea:** shrink the README to an overview plus links, keep the detailed behaviour in `FEATURES.md`, and update the
  dependency snippet to the `me.avogadro` coordinates once a release is published.
